    <h1>Democracy in Peril: A Summary</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p id="welcome">Welcome to my page. This page is divided into two parts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>"Recent Activity" is a more objective glossary of the individual events going on</li>
      <li>"Thoughts" is a more subjective essay that attempts to explain the big picture</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The one sentence summary is: <b>the fundamental, democratic structure of
        our government is being mutated via the unchecked overreach of executive
        orders and direct political control exercised by an unelected, foreign billionaire.</b> Democracy itself is
      under attack.
      This is a coup.
    </p>
    <p id="tips">A few suggestions before starting the "Recent Activity" section:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Slow down. Focus on one thing at a time.
      </li>
      <li>Links provided here are a good place to start, but you should please search on your own, too. Treat this
        section
        as a diving board into your own reading.
      </li>
      <li>Another reminder to take your time. Part of the attackers' strategy is to overwhelm us with
        this
        blitz of activity. Don't be intimidated, it's OK if you don't read everything here. Just pick one
        topic, read a couple news articles from reputable sites (of your choice) and allow yourself time to
        reflect.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>That being said, the text I've written below includes additional scope (such as protesting instructions) so I
      will leave it up.
      And maybe you'll find this essay useful anyways. Here goes.</p>
    <h3>What comes next</h3>
    <p>Donald Trump is a <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/trump-convicted-felonies/" target="_blank">convicted
        felon</a>. After losing the 2020 presidential election, in which he spread lies about widespread voter fraud and
      claimed that the election had been stolen from him, on
      January 6, 2020 he led a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack"
        target="_blank">terrorist attack on the Capitol building</a> while members of Congress were inside tallying up
      the electoral
      college votes.
      Now, he is again leading illegal activities in direct violation of the Constitution. It must be
      stated clearly: Donald Trump is anti-American. He is an enemy of democracy.</p>
    <p>His strategy is simple: instead of using laws to control policy, which requires representatives and senators to
      debate & vote, Donald Trump is attempting to seize the federal government's money to control policy. The problem
      for
      Donald Trump is that the federal government's money doesn't belong to him. It belongs to Congress. And it is
      illegal, unconstitutional to be precise,
      for him to override a budget created by Congress. Of course he doesn't care - he wants a world where he gets to
      pick the winners and losers. Bend the
      knee and align your policy with his and you will get your money. Oppose him and your agency will be
      shuttered.
    </p>
    <p>So how do we know that this is Donald Trump's strategy? It's evident from (a) his direct attempt to illegally
      freeze
      federal spending, (b) Elon Musk & DOGE's illegal attempted
      takeover
      of the
      federal payments system and (c) the <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-russell-vought-confirmation-budget-project-2025-7d1c476694176876256e95cecbd49231"
        target="_blank">appointment of Russell Vought</a> as the new Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
      director, a man who believes in a <a href="https://x.com/russvought/status/1796491951476199754"
        target="_blank">"post-Constitutional"</a> government where the president has the authority to
      negate a congressionally approved budget - giving the president arguably total control over the
      federal government's money.</p>
    <p>
      In this vision for the executive branch's future the law is replaced by ideology. If Donald
      Trump doesn't like your agency the money simply won't show up. It won't matter that laws have been signed
      mandating support
      for citizens or organizations, Donald Trump will be fully within his rights to simply deny the funding and the
      law, existing in name only, will be effectively dead. Under the pretense of "DEI" or "wokeness" he will remove all
      of his opposition in government, giving him and his associates the cover to hijack our federal agencies to pursue
      their
      own personal interests under the surface. We can already see this substitution of ideology > law happening right
      now
      with
      USAID, the
      Department
      of Education and most disturbingly, the <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/10/trump-military-services-academies-board-00203348"
        target="_blank">military [2/10/25]</a>.
    </p>
    <p>"But what about the judicial branch!", you interject. "They can stop him." Well, not if he decides to simply <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/09/us/politics/vance-trump-federal-courts-executive-order.html"
        target="_blank">ignore the courts [2/9/25]</a>. We will have a king.</p>
    <p>And as king, Donald Trump will not leave office after the 2028 election, if there even is one. He was willing to
      spread lies
      about voter fraud, lead a terrorist
      attack after losing an election and then later pardon those same terrorists. <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/28/politics/trump-putin-ukraine-russia-smart/index.html" target="_blank">He
        openly praises Russian dictator Vladimir Putin</a>. He has no limits.
      Donald Trump is not "joking"
      about running for a third or fourth term - he has his dictatorship thermometer in-hand and is merely
      taking a
      temperature reading of the room. And given the ease with which he has been allowed to exercise his will thus far,
      Constitution be damned, I predict that by the end of the next four, long years he
      will have ground down any opposition in the government sufficient enough to remove him.
    </p>
    <p>So, wow, that's a crazy thought. Donald Trump will never leave office. We the people must
      unite under the Constitution and remove him ourselves. But how?
      One option, the
      obvious preference, is that we protest with such regularity and intensity that Congress is left with no choice
      but to initiate impeachment. We flood the streets every week or so, arms locked together, marching in unity and
      demanding that our Consitutional rights be protected instead of trampled. We threaten the everyday
      normalcy of
      business-as-usual by withholding our labor in a general strike. Peacefully, yet forcefully, we demand regime
      change:
      this is option one.</p>
    <p>Failing the ability to generate enough gumption in Congress to initiate impeachment we will have arrived in a
      dark yet familiar place. Donald Trump is now a bonafide king. What he says is law.
      Nobody is left in the supreme court, FBI or military brave enough to oppose him - he
      is the arbiter of truth. At this sorry point there is only a single, tragic option left for the citizens of this
      great nation:
      embrace our roots anew.</p>
    <h3>How do we stop this</h3>
    <p>We protest, strike and demand four things:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The immediate resignation or removal of Donald Trump</li>
      <li>The immediate disbanding of DOGE and removal of Elon Musk</li>
      <li>A suspension of mass deportations</li>
      <li>The re-hiring of FBI officials fired for investigating January 6 terrorists</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Where can I find protest information?</p>
    <ul>

        <li>Tip: after opening links, try searching for your city or state in the reddit search bar at the top</li>
      </ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.mobilize.us/indivisible/" target="_blank">"Indivisible" org events page</a></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Check out their "Map" view</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Local, in-person. Help organize a protest yourself! Make a sign, get one or two friends to come with you (make
        sure you buy
        them
        a coffee as thanks) and go to your city hall or main public space to demonstrate. If people are willing to
        listen, calmly talk to them about why you're there. Going solo <a

          target="_blank">like this</a>, albeit riskier, is cool too.
        <ul>
          <li>No protest is too small. Protests grow like a snowball rolling downhill. We see people take a stand in
            public today
            and it
            gives us the courage to join them tomorrow. Be the reason somebody else decides to take a stand.
          </li>
          <li>Also consider bringing your American flag and flying it proudly. We need to take back our flag. It belongs
            to us, the people who support the Constitution. The American flag does not belong to nazis or kings.</li>

    <h3>How did we get here</h3>
    <p>Let me be very clear: Donald Trump is an evil man. That being said, there are reasons that people voted for him.
      For us to ignore those reasons is foolish. Donald Trump does not have the solutions our country desperately needs
      but one way
      of viewing his 2024
      election victory is that his campaign convinced more people of our country's problems.</p>
    <p>Donald Trump is the root cause of our current constitutional crisis but in other areas he is only a symptom.
      Our
      broken healthcare,
      housing, immigration and so-called "lobbying" (i.e. corruption) systems are the root causes underlying our
      societal
      problems. And the democratic party's lack of gumption in repairing these broken
      systems, in contrast to Donald Trump's perceived challenges of everything that built them, likely explains the
      motivations of
      many people who chose red in the last election. "He's a bull in a china shop, and we hate the china shop so much
      that we put
      the bull in there on purpose." But will Donald Trump actually fix our broken systems? No. It was all a front. He
      won't fix anything - he will only
      further cripple and exploit our broken government for his personal gain at the expense of us all. And while
      doing so he now presents a dire threat: fundamentally changing America
      into an un-free, un-democratic society.</p>
    <p>The fact remains, however, that once Donald Trump is gone the job is still not done. The broken systems remain.
      If we want to avoid
      further such tests
      of our democracy we the people must learn how to wield it. No longer can we afford to wallow in
      desperation while
      our elected representatives sit on their hands, watching as billionaires & mega-corps suffocate our media with
      propaganda and economically
      devastate our
      countrymen, just to slink home after receiving their pittance from the machine they uphold. We must be even more
      proactive in
      standing up to
      demand change from <em>our</em> government:</p>
    <p>We demand a single-payer healthcare system that is funded by taxes and free at the point-of-service.</p>
    <p>We demand more housing and especially more housing that costs less, so that we can give our countrymen real
      opportunities to get off of the streets
      and into dignified living spaces that every human deserves, instead of <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkH1dpr-p_4" target="_blank">allowing
        corporations to drive citizens into homelessness</a>.</p>
    <p>We need less people living in this country illegally. We effectively have millions of second-class citizens
      who
      have built entire lives here and provide vital labor to our economy, but who have performed no background checks
      and
      have none or very limited protections for their wages, housing, etc... Maybe
      we
      need visas specific to agricultural work - people can work here for 6 months
      at a fair wage but without full benefits granted to citizens. However we do it, we need solutions that allow
      more people to obtain legal status in our country and build a path to citizenship.</p>
    <p>We need to overturn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFpFKe3q6Fg&t=1s" target="_blank">Citizen's
        United</a>. We need to ban members of Congress from being able to <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vT-u-SPj4_c" target="_blank">trade individual stocks</a>. We need to
      reduce taxes on the
      middle class, and increase taxes on billionaires &
      mega-corporations. We need sweeping enforcement of
      anti-trust law to dismantle not only monopolies held by mega-corps such as Amazon and Google, but also more
      specialized or localized markets
      "rolled up" by private equity in markets such as <a
        href="https://www.thebignewsletter.com/p/did-a-private-equity-fire-truck-roll" target="_blank">firetruck
        production</a>, rental housing,
      <a href="https://petsatrisk.nycitynewsservice.com/2024/02/14/private-equity-buying-spree/"
        target="_blank">veterinary clinics</a>, plumbing companies, etc...
    </p>
    <p>We need to pay our teachers more and charge state university students less.</p>
    <p>First though, we must start by overcoming the anti-American, fascist disease that currently ails us - otherwise
      we
      have no
      hope or recourse of fixing anything at all.</p>
    <p>Thank you for reading. I encourage you to join me in going outside with your American flag, flying it proudly,
      and demanding
      that our Constitution and democratic way of life be protected! United we stand.</p>
